#DatasetIris_Classification
One of the projects I worked on was Iris flower species classification using Random Forest algorithm with Iris dataset from Scikit-Learn.

Process and Results:
✅ The dataset consists of 150 rows of data with three Iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
✅ The Random Forest model produced 100% accuracy on the test data, demonstrating the model's ability to classify the species perfectly.
✅ The Confusion Matrix showed that there were no classification errors, with each species correctly predicted.
