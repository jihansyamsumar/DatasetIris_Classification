# DatasetIris_Classification
## Business Understanding
The main objective is to recognize flower species quickly and precisely. This is very useful in various fields, such as biodiversity conservation, environmental research, and crop management. With a good classification model, researchers or practitioners can identify flower species just by measuring their shape, making it easier to make decisions on protecting and managing these species. 

## Data Understanding
This dataset contains data about three types of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. There are 150 samples with four features measured, namely sepal length and width and petal length and width. This analysis aims to create a model that can recognize flower types based on these traits. I'm using the dataset from scikit-learn library. Building a classification model with the Random Forest algorithm.
